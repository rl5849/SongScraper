# SongScraper
Scrape online playlists and create Spotify® playlists out of them!

Like a local radio stations playlist, but don't want to sit there and search songs and drag them to a playlist?
Song scraper can quickly parse a JSON list of songs, find them on Spotify®, and add them to a playlist for you.
Many stations already have endpoints that their own websites use to display and update their recently played songs (Find them takes a bit of time to do in a browsers debugger)
